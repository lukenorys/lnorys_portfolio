                <p> My Name is Luke Norys. I currently live in the Chicagoland area. I am looking to transition from the Healthcare Industry into tech. <br>
                I have a passion for developing and maintaning systems all while constantly learning what is new. <br>
                I would consider myself more of a problem solver over analyst or developer. I enjoy collaborating to create stunning and interactive projects for customers.<br>
                I'd love a chance to develop my skills and work with you to see your project through. Please contact me through channels listed in my "Contact Me" section.<br>
                <em><strong>Happy coding!</strong></em></p>
