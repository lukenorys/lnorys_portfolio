                <p> My Name is Luke Norys. I am currently enrolled in the University of Wisconsin Coding Bootcamp to learn full-stack web development.<br>
                    I currently live in the Chicagoland area. I am looking to transition from the Healthcare Industry into tech. <br>
                    I have a passion for developing and maintaning systems all while constantly learning what is new. <br>
                    I would consider myself more of a problem solver over analyst or developer. I enjoy collaborating to create stunning and interactive projects for customers.<br>
                    I'd love a chance to develop my skills and work with you to see your project through. Please contact me through channels listed in my "Contact Me" section.<br>
                    <em><strong>Happy coding!</strong></em>

                        <p> Run Buddy task was to create a landing page to attract new clients.<br>
                            The hero/jumbotron contains a form for customers to input their information so Run Buddy can reach out to them.<br>
                            There is also information about the company and their trainers. This is followed by a contact form with an interactive map embedded.<br>

                    </div>
                        <p> Horiseon needed their website to be more accesible.<br>
                            The goal was not only to add "alt" descriptions to images, but also scout the code.<br>
                            The style.css file had the same code written multiple times. Through the process of refactoring,<br>
                            the DRY (don't repeat yourself) method was used and the code was cleaned up!<br>
                            The entire process gave the website a Lighthouse "Best Practice" score of 100 and 'Accessibility' score of 93.<br>
                            In the end their search engine optimization took a great turn for the better.<br>
                            I also added in a hex-color theme matching Favicon as an extra feature.<br>
